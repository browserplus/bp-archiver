This repo can be used to build the BrowserPlus archiver service.
This service uses libarchive and supports creating zip, uncompressed zip,
tar, gzipped tar, and bzipped tar archives.

This service uses submodules browserplus/bakery, browserplus/bp-file, 
and browserplus/bp-service-framework.
 
Instructions to build the service are in the file BUILDING.
